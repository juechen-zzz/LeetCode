'''
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:

Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.

class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid[0]), len(grid)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
        
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
        for j in range(1, m):
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, m):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
        
        return dp[-1][-1]
